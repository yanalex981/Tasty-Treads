Each day, you will receive orders from customers that you take from the orders conveyor belt

If you're ever lost, the area to the top left will remind you of your tasks, and right now, it is to pick up the next order

You pick up the order, and it's a cake you've got to bake. Your first step is to grab the ingredients, so you head on over to the highlighted area

You pick up the ingredients ... make sure to AVOID picking up the toxic stuff, why that stuff is in a fridge is a mystery nobody will ever solve ðŸ˜‰

You bum around and finish up a bunch of other tasks ... this here is the baking task. Make sure you don't burn it!

Don't make the customer wait, cool off the cake at supersonic speeds and start the next one! There's only 24 hours in a day ðŸ˜

At the end of the day, you can spend your hard earned cash on upgrades to make yourself more efficient at churning out stuff
